ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in combining data from multiple tables using SQL. By practicing different types of JOIN operations, you'll learn how to merge related data efficiently and meaningfully.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
DB Browser for SQLite or

MySQL Workbench

These tools allow you to create and manage databases, write SQL queries, and visualize results effectively.

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
Queries demonstrating the use of:

INNER JOIN â€“ to get only matching records between tables.

LEFT JOIN â€“ to get all records from the left table and matching ones from the right.

RIGHT JOIN â€“ to get all records from the right table and matching ones from the left.

FULL OUTER JOIN â€“ to get all records when there's a match in either table.

ðŸ§© Concept Overview
Two tables (like Customers and Orders) are used to simulate real-world relationships.

JOINs help you query across these tables to answer business questions (e.g., "Which customers placed orders?", "Which orders don't have customer info?", etc.).

FULL OUTER JOINs are often simulated in MySQL using a combination of LEFT and RIGHT JOINs with UNION.

ðŸ§  Learning Outcome
By completing this project, you will:

Understand the differences between various JOIN types

Be able to combine and compare related datasets

Recognize when and how to use each JOIN for practical data problems

Build a strong foundation for relational database queries
